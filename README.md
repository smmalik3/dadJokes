Skill Invocation

You can ask Alexa to ruin someone's day by asking for a random dad joke. You get a new joke every time you ask her. You can initiate the skill by saying:

"Alexa, open dad jokes."

After the welcome message you can then say any of the following:

"Tell me a joke"
"Tell me a fresh joke"
"Tell me a dad joke"
"Let's get this over with."

Alternatively, to skip the welcome message and dive straight into some painful comedy (can we even call it that?) you can say the following:

"Alexa, ask dad jokes to tell me a joke."
"Alexa, ask dad jokes for a joke."
"Alexa, ask dad jokes to tell me a fresh joke."
"Alexa, ask dad jokes for a fresh joke."
"Alexa, ask dad jokes to tell me a dad joke."
"Alexa, ask dad jokes for a dad joke."
"Alexa, ask dad jokes to end my suffering."
